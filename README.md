# BlazorLife
This is my attempt to build Conway's Game Of Life that works in browser using client-side .NET Blazor technology.
<p>I added a few controls to make it a bit interactive, so except for the grid with cells it has start/stop/reset button, slider for grid density, and a mode selection.</p>
<p>You can add gliders or just new cells by clicking on the grid. In glider mode direction can be chosen.</p>
